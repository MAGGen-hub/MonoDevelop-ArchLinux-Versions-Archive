This is the monodevelop-bin-7.8.4.1_0xamarin6_ubuntu1804b1-2 version. 
The version I prefer to use and the only one tested by me)

Use PKGBUILD ans .SRCINFO to build it with makepkg.
Or download monodevelop-bin-7.8.4.1_0xamarin6_ubuntu1804b1-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst and run it with pacman -U command.

Special thanks to William Tumeo. PKGBUILD I get from his monodevelop-bin repository: https://github.com/williamd1k0/monodevelop-bin

I copied his files because I am afraid that his repo could disapear as fast as monodevelop-bin package in AUR.

I apologize if the copyright has been violated...
