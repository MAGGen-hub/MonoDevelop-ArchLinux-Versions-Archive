            <summary>
            Since BuildEngine class directly access MSBuild types it tries to load Microsoft.Build.dll assembly when
            constructor is called so before Initialize is called which specifies msbuildBinDir and installs MSBuildAssemblyResolver.
            To solve this problem we use AssemblyResolver class which we install as listener to RemoteProcessServer(implicitly in Connect call).
            and after installing MSBuildAssemblyResolver we create BuildEngine and add it as Listener and remove AssemblyResolver
            as if it was never there.
