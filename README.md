Hi Arch Linux users! This repo was created for people who used MonoDevelop as primary IDE for C# programming.
Yes MonoDevelop is "no longer supported" (see this https://blog.lextudio.com/the-end-of-monodevelop-80b383dab34b)
but I need to say that this is still the best (at last for me) C# IDE for linux users 
that very similar to Visual Studio 2019.
